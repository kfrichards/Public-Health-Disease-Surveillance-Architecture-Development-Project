# Public-Health-Disease-Surveillance-Architecture-Development-Project

In this project, five virtual machines were developed and configured to facilitate data analysis and exchange in a secure environment.  Of the virutal machines generated, four of them were hospitals and one Health Information Exchange (HIE). OpenEMR was installed as the EHR for each hospital and synthetic patient and syndromic surveillance data was generated using Synthea, an open-source software application.  A HAPI-FHIR server was also configured within the UPHIE virtual machine environment.
