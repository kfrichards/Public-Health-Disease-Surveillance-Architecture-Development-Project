# Public-Health-Disease-Surveillance-Architecture-Development-Project

In this project, five virtual machines were developed and configured to facilitate data analysis and exchange in a secure environment.  Of the virutal machines generated, four of them were hospitals and one Health Information Exchange (HIE). OpenEMR was installed as the EHR for each hospital and synthetic patient and syndromic surveillance data was generated using Synthea, an open-source software application.  A HAPI-FHIR server was also configured within the UPHIE virtual machine environment. 

<h3> &nbsp;Virtual Machines </h3>
Operating Systems: Aspirus Hospital, Portage Health, Baraga County Memorial Hospital, Marquette General, and Upper Peninsula Health Information Exchange (UPHIE)

<h3> &nbsp;OpenEMR </h3>
OpenEMR is an open-source EHR software system designed to streamline and digitize the workflows of healthcare providers. OpenEMR was securely installed on each VM with Ubuntu server

<h3> &nbsp;Synthea </h3>
Synthea is an open-source software application used to generate synthetic patient data for use in healthcare simulation, research, and testing purposes.  Synthea was successfully installed to generate patient and Covid-19 messages within a geographic region to simulate disease outbreak.

<h3> &nbsp;HAPI-FHIR Configuration </h3>
HAPI-FHIR is an open-source implementation of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard.  HAPI-FHIR was installed and configured within the UPHIE VM. 

<h3> &nbsp;Technical Skills Demonstrated </h3>
